Hello, this little quiz is a homage to the many games of dungeons and dragons I've played and while the questions are mostly just jokes the code is real. This is a project I created to practice some of the fundamentals of JavaScript. It helped me practice logic and methods. I'm hoping this project is a turning point for me because I hit a wall about half way and just couldn't move one. However just like anything else putting a little bit of my sense of humor into it really brought me around and put me in the correct mind space to keep the coding going. This is a lesson that I've learned before but some how manage to forget over and over again hopefully it'll stick with me a bit longer this time.

A few other things to note. First I want to give a shout out to my tutor he gave me a solid start on this project and had been invaluable to my learning. Second the code here is not done I've ran out of time and while I logged the finishing time in the local memory I didn't retrieve it onto a scoreboard. That being said I'm happy with the results.
